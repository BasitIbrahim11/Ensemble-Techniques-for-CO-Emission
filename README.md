# Ensemble-Techniques-for-CO-Emission
This project predicts carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from vehicles using ensemble machine learning models including Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, and Voting Regressors. It includes data preprocessing, outlier removal, encoding, scaling, and evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE metrics.
